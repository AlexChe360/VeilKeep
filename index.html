  <h1>VeilKeep — Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 6, 2025</p>

  <h2>At a glance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sign-in uses <strong>Sign in with Apple</strong> only (authentication and account identification).</li>
    <li>All note content, checklists, and attachments are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and <strong>encrypted</strong>. The encryption key stays on your device; we do not have access to it.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use advertising trackers or third-party analytics SDKs.</li>
    <li>We may use <strong>notifications</strong> (if you allow them) to remind you about app-related events.</li>
    <li>You can optionally share a note via a link. Shared content is encrypted on your device with an access code you choose. We do not receive the access code.</li>
    <li>Shared items are stored temporarily on our server in encrypted form only and are automatically deleted after they expire or reach the maximum number of opens.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
  <p>
    VeilKeep (the “App”, “we”, “us”, “our”).<br>
    VeilKeep is developed and published by an independent developer. Developer contact details are provided in the
    <a href="#contact-us">Contact us</a> section below.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Data we process</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Authentication (Sign in with Apple)</h3>
  <p>
    VeilKeep uses <strong>Sign in with Apple</strong> as its authentication method.
  </p>
  <p>When you sign in with Apple, Apple provides the App with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A stable <strong>user identifier</strong> specific to VeilKeep.</li>
    <li>Your <strong>email address</strong>, which can be either your real email or a private relay email, depending on what you choose during sign-in.</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens required to keep you signed in.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We <strong>do not</strong> receive your Apple ID password. Sign in with Apple is fully handled by Apple; VeilKeep only
    receives the minimum information needed to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and recognize your VeilKeep account on this device,</li>
    <li>Keep you signed in,</li>
    <li>Associate purchases or features with your Apple identity where applicable.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not run a separate username/password system on our own servers.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 On-device data (local)</h3>
  <p>
    VeilKeep is designed so that your note content stays on your device.
  </p>
  <p>We store locally on your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notes and checklists,</li>
    <li>Attachments (for example, files or other content you add),</li>
    <li>Encryption keys and metadata needed for secure offline storage,</li>
    <li>App settings and preferences (e.g., theme, lock options, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data <strong>does not leave your device</strong> unless you explicitly choose to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Export or share notes/attachments via the system share sheet or similar, or</li>
    <li>Include the App’s data in device backups that you control (for example, iOS backups).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We <strong>cannot decrypt your notes</strong>: the encryption key is stored only on your device and is never sent to us
    or to Apple as part of VeilKeep.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Shared links (optional)</h3>
  <p>
    VeilKeep includes an optional feature that lets you share a note via a link.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you create a shared link:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The note (or a snapshot of the note) is encrypted <strong>on your device</strong> before upload using an <strong>access code</strong> you choose.</li>
    <li>We receive and store only the encrypted payload and limited metadata necessary to operate the sharing feature, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>a share token (link identifier),</li>
        <li>an expiration time (validity period / TTL) and maximum number of opens (view limit),</li>
        <li>optional non-sensitive metadata such as a note title (if you choose to include it).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We <strong>do not receive</strong> the access code and <strong>cannot decrypt</strong> the shared content. The access code is never sent to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    When someone opens the link:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>They must enter the access code to decrypt the content.</li>
    <li>Decryption happens <strong>locally on the recipient’s device</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Retention and deletion:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encrypted shared payloads are stored temporarily and are automatically deleted when the link expires or the maximum number of opens is reached (whichever comes first).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.4 Notifications data</h3>
  <p>
    If you allow <strong>notifications</strong>, VeilKeep may process:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple reminder or status information needed to show notifications (for example, that a reminder should be displayed at a certain time).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Notification content is derived from your local app data and processed on your device. We do <strong>not</strong> upload
    your note content to our own servers for the purpose of notifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can control notification settings in your device settings (see <a href="#device-permissions">Device permissions</a> below).
  </p>

  <h3>2.5 Diagnostics and logs</h3>
  <p>
    By default, VeilKeep does <strong>not</strong> include in-app analytics or behavioral tracking.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, your device and the app store provider (for example, Apple) may collect <strong>optional crash reports and diagnostics</strong>,
    if you opt in at the system level. These may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device model,</li>
    <li>Operating system version,</li>
    <li>App version,</li>
    <li>Technical information about a crash or error.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We may access this data in aggregate to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improve app stability,</li>
    <li>Diagnose problems,</li>
    <li>Make future compatibility decisions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can control whether to share such diagnostics in your device’s privacy/analytics settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Purposes &amp; legal bases</h2>
  <p>
    Where applicable (e.g., under GDPR), our legal bases for processing are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Contract performance</strong><br>
      To provide sign-in with Apple and maintain your session.<br>
      To operate VeilKeep’s core functionality (encrypted local notes).<br>
      To provide the optional shared links feature when you choose to use it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legitimate interests</strong><br>
      To ensure security and prevent abuse.<br>
      To maintain and improve app stability and performance using limited technical diagnostics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consent</strong><br>
      For notifications, if you allow them in system settings.<br>
      For OS-level diagnostics/crash sharing, where governed by your device settings.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You may withdraw your consent to optional permissions at any time through your device settings.
  </p>

  <h2>4) Storage &amp; retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Auth tokens</strong> from Sign in with Apple may be stored in secure device storage (e.g., Keychain) and are removed when you sign out or delete the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Local notes, checklists, and attachments</strong> remain on your device for as long as you keep them in the App or until you delete the App and its data.</li>
    <li><strong>Notification schedules and related metadata</strong> are kept locally as long as needed for notifications to function, or until you disable them or delete the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared links</strong>: encrypted share payloads are retained only for the configured validity period and/or until the maximum number of opens is reached, and are then automatically deleted from our server.</li>
    <li>Any OS-level crash/diagnostic data is managed by Apple according to their own policies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    VeilKeep does not maintain a separate remote database of your note content.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Where processing occurs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your note content, encryption keys, and notification data are processed <strong>on your device</strong>.</li>
    <li>Shared link content is encrypted on your device and stored temporarily on our server in encrypted form only to deliver it to recipients.</li>
    <li>Authentication data is processed by <strong>Apple</strong> when you use Sign in with Apple.</li>
    <li>Any OS-level backups or analytics are processed by Apple under its own terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Sharing with third parties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not sell</strong> your personal data.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party advertising SDKs or trackers in VeilKeep.</li>
    <li>Apple acts as:
      <ul>
        <li>the identity provider for Sign in with Apple, and</li>
        <li>the platform provider (iOS, App Store, backup and analytics infrastructure).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For the shared links feature, we store encrypted payloads on our own infrastructure solely to deliver them to recipients.</li>
    <li>Data may be disclosed if required by law (e.g., a valid court order) and only to the extent legally required.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> share your encrypted note content with any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect the limited data processed through VeilKeep:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notes and attachments are <strong>encrypted locally</strong>, with keys stored only on your device.</li>
    <li>Shared links store only encrypted payloads on our servers; we do not have the access code and cannot decrypt shared content.</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens and sensitive items are stored in secure device storage where available.</li>
    <li>We minimize the amount of data sent outside the device and rely primarily on on-device processing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No system can be perfectly secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device
    (for example, by using a passcode and not sharing your Apple ID credentials).
  </p>

  <h2>8) Your rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your personal data,</li>
    <li>Correct inaccurate data,</li>
    <li>Request deletion of data (“right to be forgotten”),</li>
    <li>Restrict or object to certain kinds of processing,</li>
    <li>Data portability (where applicable),</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In practice:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Local notes and attachments</strong><br>
      You can manage and delete them directly inside VeilKeep or by deleting the App and its data from your device.
      We cannot decrypt or remotely access your notes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shared links</strong><br>
      You can stop sharing by deleting the shared item in the App (where available) or by waiting for it to expire / reach its maximum opens.
      Shared payloads are encrypted and automatically deleted after expiry or view limit.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sign in with Apple data</strong><br>
      You can manage app access in your Apple ID settings (e.g., revoke Sign in with Apple for VeilKeep).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Because much of the relevant data is controlled by Apple (Apple ID, iOS diagnostics, backups), some actions must be performed using Apple’s tools and settings.
    If you have questions or requests related specifically to VeilKeep, please contact us (see below).
  </p>

  <h2>9) Children</h2>
  <p>
    VeilKeep is <strong>not intended for individuals under 13</strong> (or another age defined by local law in your jurisdiction).
    We do not knowingly collect data from such users.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe that a child under the relevant age has used VeilKeep and provided data in a way that we control, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>11) Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. When we do:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The updated version will be made available in the App and/or on our website, and</li>
    <li>The “Last updated” date at the top will indicate when the changes took effect.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your continued use of VeilKeep after an updated Policy takes effect means that you accept the changes.
  </p>

  <h2>12) Account deletion and Sign in with Apple</h2>
  <p>
    VeilKeep does not maintain a separate remote account database; your identity in the App is tied to
    <strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To effectively “delete your account” in the context of VeilKeep, you can:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Revoke Sign in with Apple access</strong> for VeilKeep in your Apple ID settings:
      <ul>
        <li>On your device, go to <em>Settings → [your name] → Password &amp; Security → Apps Using Your Apple ID</em>,</li>
        <li>Select VeilKeep and choose to stop using Apple ID with this app.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Delete local data</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>Delete your notes and attachments directly in the App, or</li>
        <li>Delete the VeilKeep app from your device (which typically removes its local data).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If you have additional questions about account-related data, you can contact us by email.
  </p>

  <h2 id="device-permissions">13) Device permissions</h2>
  <p>
    VeilKeep may request the following permission:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Notifications (Push / Local Notifications)</strong> – to send you app-related alerts, such as reminders or status
      updates related to your content or app activity.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Details:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notification content is generated from your local app data and processed on your device.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> send your encrypted note content to our own servers for the purpose of notifications.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can revoke notification permissions at any time in your device settings. If you do so, VeilKeep will remain usable,
    but certain features (such as reminders or alerts) may no longer function as intended.
